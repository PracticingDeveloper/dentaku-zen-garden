## SETUP SCENARIO:
Startup business model is the "Etsy" of DIY zen gardens. (Market viability left
as an exercise for the reader) Users of the site can post projects that define a
shopping list for the materials to build their particular design of zen garden,
but the purchaser can customize the dimensions of the garden, so quantities must
be calculated at runtime based on the user-supplied dimensions.

## INTRO:
One option to solve this sort of problem is to allow the users to specify
material quantites as formulas based on the dimensions, and use a formula
evaluation library like Dentaku to perform the runtime calculation. Dentaku
takes a string that represents a formula, along with a hash specifying variable
values to be substituted into the formula, and returns the evaluated result of
the formula.

For example, the formula "length * width" evaluated with the context
{ 'length' => 5, 'width' => 3 } would evaluate to 15.

## MAIN:
Walk through development of solution...
  - high level:
    - model projects as CSV files
    - prompt user to select project
    - use Dentaku to determine required variables
    - prompt user for variable values
    - use Dentaku to solve for quanities, total weight
    - present Bill of Materials, shipping cost

  - potential points to discuss:
    - solving set of multiple dependent formulas automatically
    - performance vs direct Ruby implementation
    - alternate approaches/implementation
    - Dentaku internals
